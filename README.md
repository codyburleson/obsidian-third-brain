# Obsidian Third Brain Plugin

This is the development vault for the Obsidian 3rd Brain Plugin

For getting started with plugin development, [.obsidian/plugins/third-brain/README.md](.obsidian/plugins/third-brain/README.md).

## About

The Obsidian Third Brain Plugin is my personal A.I. study and practice project which seeks to apply A.I. agents and Large Language Models (LLMs) to personal and professional knowledge management.

### The Basic Idea

The basic idea is simple:

Given a personal or professional knowledge vault (comprised of Obsidian markdown documents), with various information architectures (information schemes or structures understood by A.I. agents), apply the power of Large Language Models to enhance knowledge management.
